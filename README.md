Tic-Tac-Toe is a simple and fun game for 2 players, X and O. The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares. Each player's goal is to make 3 of their own mark in a row (vertically, horizontally, or diagonally).

When clicked on an empty cell, X or O will appear, alternately, representing one of the two players. The player who is playing "X" always goes first. Players take turns placing their mark, X or O, on an open square in the grid. The first player to get 3 of her marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.Â 

When all 9 squares are full, the game is over. It's a draw if there's no winner.
